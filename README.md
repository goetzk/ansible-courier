Courier
=======

This role manages the install of Courier IMAP and performs basic configuration.
It is still at an early stage of development and should gain features over
time.

Requirements
------------

Any pre-requisites that may not be covered by Ansible itself or the role should be mentioned here. For instance, if the role uses the EC2 module, it may be a good idea to mention in this section that the boto package is required.

Role Variables
--------------

These files will be generated by the SSL creation code.
courier_imap_ssl_key: /etc/courier/imapd.key
courier_imap_ssl_cert: /etc/courier/imapd.crt
courier_imap_ssl_csr: /etc/courier/imapd.csr

Dependencies
------------

None at the moment

Example Playbook
----------------

Including an example of how to use your role (for instance, with variables passed in as parameters) is always nice for users too:

    - hosts: servers
      roles:
         - { role: goetzk.courier , courier_imap_ssl_key: /etc/courier/imapd.key }
